      Gameroom started as a small dormroom ebay operation over 10 years ago.  In 2007 the first retail store was opened on O St, and we have been growing ever since.  Gameroom now supports multiple locations as well as 30+ employees.  We are constantly expanding our evergrowing selection of merchandise and services.   Our ambitious growth has led the Gameroom down exciting new avenues such as software development.  We anxiously anticipate the release of a slew of software products that will revolutionize how the Gameroom operates, and unlock possibilities for many small businesses.

      Gameroom was founded on the basic fundamental of being an ethical business.  We believe in the products and services that we offer, and we value our customers and employees alike.  Gameroom has run into many struggles and obstacles along the way to becoming a fully mature business, and we attack the challenges head on.  We are not a perfect organization, but we treat all our failures as an opportunity to learn and grow as a company, and as a way to develop solutions through our software, to pave the way to success for many small businesses caught in the gears of the trying to grow.  We would like to thank all of those who have supported us on these endeavors, and hope that continually raise the standards under which we operate, and provide ever improving products and services to our customers.
